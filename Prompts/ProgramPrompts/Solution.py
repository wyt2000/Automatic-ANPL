Solution = """-----Question-----
{question}

-----Task-----
Propose a clever and efficient high-level solution for this problem. Consider all edge cases and failure modes.

Some common strategies include:
    Constructive algorithms, Binary search, Depth-first search (DFS) and similar algorithms, Dynamic programming, Bitmasks, Brute force, Greedy algorithms, Graphs, Two pointers, Trees, Geometry, Graph matchings, Hashing, Probabilities, Data structures, Sortings, Games, Number theory, Combinatorics, Divide and conquer, Disjoint set union (DSU), Expression parsing

Let's think step by step to come up with a clever algorithm.
You should only output high-level solution without any pseudocode or code.
