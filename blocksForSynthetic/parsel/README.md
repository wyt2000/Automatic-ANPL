# üêç Parsel

**Parsel** is a natural language framework for writing programs for any target language using code language models. Parsel considers multiple implementations for each function, searching sets of implementations to find programs passing unit tests (more generally, program constraints). It can be used for many kinds of algorithmic tasks, e.g. code synthesis, robotic planning, and theorem proving.

## Installation
To get use this repo, it should be enough to just:

```
git clone https://github.com/ezelikman/parsel.git
pip install openai
```
## Notebook
We provide an [intro notebook](https://github.com/ezelikman/parsel/blob/main/parsel.ipynb) showing how to interact with Parsel.

## Examples
In order to run this project, here are some example commands:
- `python parsel.py programs/problem_solving.ss` will run and transpile the program in the file `programs/problem_solving.ss`.
- `python parsel.py programs/collatz_recursion.ss` shows an example of a recursive function.
- `python parsel.py programs/problem_solving_no_tests.ss -g` shows how you can use automatic test generation to write programs without tests.
- `python parsel.py programs/game_of_life_inverse_no_args.ss -n` shows how you can use natural language to write programs without argument names.
- `python parsel.py programs/problem_solving_no_args_no_tests.ss -g -n` shows how you can use automatic test generation to write programs without tests or argument names, i.e. in entirely natural language.
- To run `python parsel.py programs/and_commute.ss`, change the mode in `consts/__init__.py` to `lean` and (assuming you have Lean installed), it will generate a Lean file in the same directory as the input file.
- To run `game_of_life_inverse_expand.ss` you will need to use the `-e` flag to automatically expand / decompose it.
- To run `game_of_life_inverse_fill.ss` you will need to use the `-a` to autofill the program with functions that are called but not used.

In general, to configure Parsel for a new target programming, you'll need to create a new file in `consts/` and add it to `consts/__init__.py`. In addition, to use the OpenAI models, you'll need to create a `keys/codex_key.txt` file in the format `organization_id:api_key`.
